# COVID-19-WEB-ANALYTICS-APP
This project leverages the power of the Streamlit library to build a live and interactive COVID-19 web application which allows users to explore and interact with the data and avail themselves to numerous functionalities. The ultimate goal is to create an intuitive and highly functional interface which enables a deep understanding of COVID-19 incidences around the world for non-technical users.
